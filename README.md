# Baby Store 
## baby store is an e-commerce app by react js and json-server to simulate the data come from backend service
view Demo : [Demo Link ](https://baby-store-store.netlify.app/) <br> </br>
its conseder the first react app i have done 
i used all i learned through my journey : 
1.react fundamentals 
2.react hooks 
3. react router 
4.react redux (toolkit) 
5.json-server 

in json-server i just used the shoes fake data to simulate the GET request 
and in Add to card process i didn't use POST request i made it local to practice more in js functionality
the same thing in delete from cart i use js filter to filter the cart array 

## I intentionally refrain from modifying old code or my knowledge of the correct method when working on projects.
I work gradually and methodically.

i use createasyncthunk in toolkit to manage side effects for GET shoes data 

I had to convert this project to Vite so you can see the olde virsion on e-commmerce repo in my git hub 
so i eidit some code like i remove Portal popup menue and error message if user click to add to cart button with no count

you can also see the app through video on linkedin [linkedin video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basem-salah-254894215_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%AF-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D9%84%D8%A7-activity-7024089759136268288-2Dzw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
